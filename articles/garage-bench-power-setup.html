    <h1>How I Built My Garage Bench Power Setup</h1>

    <p>
      I wanted a compact bench setup that could handle chargers, test gear, and one surprise load without tripping breakers.
      The key upgrades were a switched power strip, clear cable routing, and labeling everything up front.

    <p>
      If I had to summarize the whole build: prioritize safety first, convenience second, and expandability third.
      It is way easier to start simple and add capability than to unwind a complicated layout later.
